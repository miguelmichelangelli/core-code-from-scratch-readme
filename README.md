        <p><b>Asignation 1: Create an explanation about Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages</b></p<>
        <p>Compiled language:<br>
        This type of language translate the source code into machine code directly by the target machine, they use to be faster than interpreted languages for this reason. Examples of Compiled Languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Interpreted Languages:<br>
        Instead, in the Interpreted Language a program (also know as interpreter) is who reads and executes the code, not the target machine directly. This type of language is a little slower than the compiled one, but also is more flexible and the program size is smaller. Examples of Interpreted Languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. </p>
